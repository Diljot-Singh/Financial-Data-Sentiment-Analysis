Among financial markets, news and investor sentiment play a significant role indetermining security prices. 
In order to identify patterns and trends that are helpfulfor market participants and regulators, modern Natural Language Processing (NLP)approaches can be used to identify financial text sentiment.  
In this project we implement and compare a set of Deep Learning (DL) and non-DL based models for identifying the sentiment of financial text.  
We fine-tune BERT and achievean accuracy of 97% on test set of the Financial PhraseBank dataset. 
Additionally,we also highlight key differences in the learnings of the models by comparingpredictions of TF-IDF embedding based models and fine-tuned BERT.
